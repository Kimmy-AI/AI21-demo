To train a custom model, you will need to collect a dataset of training examples. Each example consists of a prompt, which is a valid input text, and a completion, which is a correct output for that specific prompt.

ðŸ”¢ How many examples do I need?
At least 50 training examples are required to train a custom model. If you upload a file that contains fewer than 50 examples, you will encounter an error. More is better, so provide as many examples as you can.

ðŸ§© It's all about quantity?
No! Data quality and diversity matter as well, so itâ€™s a good idea to go over your examples manually and make sure they accurately capture various aspects of your task. It's critical that your examples reflect the real-world distribution of your problem.

File Formats
The dataset must be submitted in a single .csv or .jsonl file. We recommend using a .jsonl file due to better handling of line breaks.

If you are submitting a .csv file, it should have two columns labeled "prompt" and "completion". Each row should contain a single training example, with no empty rows in between.

If you are submitting a .jsonl file, each line in the file should be a JSON dictionary with two fields: "prompt" and "completion".
